## Potential Remediations 

### Tributary to Parsnip River - PSCIS crossing 6745

```{r  load-data-6745}
my_site <- 6745

```

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.
This site is located approximately
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-6745)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available within provincial databases for the area upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

#### Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}  

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-6745)). Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

#### Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}  

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There were abundant undercut banks suitable for juvenile rearing. The stream channel is smaller and narrower than upstream. There were small gravels suitable for smaller fish. The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning due to low flow volumes and a lack of deep pools.

#### Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}  

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-6745-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This is a small, perennial stream. There were abundant gravels present, suitable for resident rainbow. Some deep pools up to 45cm in depth were present that would be suitable for rearing. There was an abundance of undercut banks and larger gravels about 30 cm in size. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

<br>

#### Conclusion {-}  

Modelling indicates there is 
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_m)/1000, 1)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for bull trout rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. The culvert is considered passable and not a fish passage issue at this time. There were abundant gravels present upstream of the crossing, but no fish were spotted. Due to the lack of historic fisheries information upstream, fish sampling is recommended to determine if fish are utilising this tributary as a spawning and rearing location.

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There were trace amounts of undercut banks and pools that were suitable for rearing. Abundant gravels were present that would be suitable for resident rainbow spawning. There was abundant woody debris that added complexity to the stream habitat and provided cover for resident fish.  The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` The water was tinged brown at the time of survey; likely from beaver activity upstream. No gravels were present suitable for spawning and the substrate was composed primarily of angular rock. Several rock steps 50-60cm high were present in the first 300m of survey that would prevent upstream juvenile salmonid migration. There was a crossing modelled upstream (ID 16601526) that was accessed to check for a structure and assess habitat. There was a large beaver dam approximately 1.6m in height at this location at the time of survey. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

<br>

#### Conclusion {-}  

Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Modelling indicates 
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_m)/1000)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for bull trout rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. However, there is a beaver dam 1.6m in height located approximately 800m upstream of this crossing. This would likely block the upstream migration of all fish species and life stages. In order to open up habitat in this system, it is recommended that beaver management methods be pursued at this location.

### Fern Creek - PSCIS crossing 125261

```{r  load-data-125261}
my_site <- 125261
my_site2 <- 16601271
```

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River, at km 2.1 on the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`.  Canfor Corporation are the road tenure holders at this site.  

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125261)).  Fish species confirmed upstream of the FSR include burbot, rainbow trout, bull trout, sucker, reside shiner and chub . A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland are modelled upstream. This includes Fern Lakes, a collection of three lakes that have a combined area of approximately 138ha. The outlet of the first lake in the chain is 3.3km upstream of the FSR.

<br>

PSCIS crossing 198321 was modelled as located on Fern Creek approximately 700m upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. However, upon visiting this location, this site was located at the end of an ATV trail and there was no structure or ford location.  Additionally, the ATV trail did not continue beyond this point as the historic road was completely overgrown. There are a number of crossings modelled on the mainstem of Fern Creek upstream of the FSR, however review of aerial imagery and deactivation of the road closer to that FSR provide significant weight of evidence that none are likely to exist. 

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-125261) and a map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

```{r}
# There are two other crossings (ID 16601842) modelled before the confluence with the lake closest to the FSR. One the mainstem of the stream and chain of lakes there are crossings modelled as between the first and second lakes (modelled_crossing_id 16600823) and between the second and third lakes (modelled_crossing_id 16600822).

#### Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}  

At the time of survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-125261)). The culvert has baffles in it to assist upstream fish passage. However, at the time of survey, the baffles were not functioning properly as they were not effectively holding back substrate. Rip rap at the outlet was creating a cascade approximately 0.5m in height that could block the migration of younger resident fish, depending on flow velocities. Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'ds') %>% pull(comments)
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)

```

#### Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}  

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` Extensive gravels were found in the first 150 m surveyed downstream. The habitat then transitions to a wetland type, with depths of up to 1m on the floodplain. The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

#### Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}  

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` This is a large stream with abundant gravel suitable for spawning and deep pools for overwintering. Numerous fish were observed, the habitat was stable with large woody debris found throughout, and there were abundant undercut banks. At the end of the survey, a stream crossing was listed in the PSCIS database (ID 198321). Upon investigation, it was concluded that this crossing was deavticated `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-07) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-08)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-u03))."))` Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was 
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

<br>

#### Conclusion {-}  

Modelling indicates that there is 
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_m)/1000, 1)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for bull trout rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Due to the lack of historic fisheries information upstream of the crossing, it is recommended that electrofishing be conducted in this area. Fish were spotted on the habitat survey upstream in 2022. Future fish sampling would help confirm migration patterns of resident populations. Additionally, it is recommended that Fern Creek be surveyed further upstream to confirm the presence (or absence) of barriers between crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Fern Lakes.

## Planned Remediations 

### Tributary to Parsnip River - PSCIS crossing 125000  

```{r  load-data-125000}
my_site <- 125000

```

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a tributary to Parsnip River, approximately 2km upstream of the confluence with the Parsnip River, on the Chuchinka-Arctic FSR. This site is situated approximately 9km north-west of the outlet of Arctic Lake. Arctic Lake is located within Arctic Pacific Lakes Provincial Park and has an area of 112ha. The park has significant historical and recreational values and is located on Mcleod Lake indian band reservation lands. The lake supports a diverse population of fish, including lake trout, bull trout, rainbow trout, kokanee, dolly varden, mountain whitefish, redside shiner, lake char, and chinook salmon, and arctic grayling [@bcparks2020ArcticPacific]. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, this tributary to Parsnip River is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125000)). There are no other stream crossings on the mainstem of this stream that block fish passage. Rainbow trout and sculpin have been captured in the past both upstream and downstream of the crossing. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [93I.111](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/parsnip/archive/2022-05-27/FishPassage_093I.111.pdf).

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high priority for remediation following habitat confirmations done by @irvine2020ParsnipRiver in 2019. At that time, there was an estimated 3.5km of habitat with a gradient less than 5% available upstream of the crossing. Habitat was rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish sampling done in 2019 confirmed that rainbow trout and sculpin were found downstream of the crossing. There were no fish captured upstream of the crossing. At the time of survey in 2019, the culvert was a complete barrier to upstream fish passage, having an outlet drop of 0.4m and a outlet pool depth of 1.5m. A detailed overview of stream characteristics and habitat details can be found in the [2019 report](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125000.html). 

<br>

This site was reassessed in 2021, with drone survey and fish sampling conducted. At the time of survey in 2021, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_reassessments, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage. This culvert is very undersized which is evidenced by the large outlet drop of 0.6m and outlet pool depth of 2m.

#### Fish Sampling {-}  

Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables
\@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125000) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125000) and
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125000). Rainbow trout and sculpin were captured both upstream and downstream of the crossing. There was only one adult fish caught (rainbow), with the rest of the fish captured being parr, fry or juveniles. The majority of fish caught were tagged using Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT), with the exception of smaller fish for risk of causing harm.

## Completed Remediations  

### Tributary to Missinka River - PSCIS crossing 125179  

```{r  load-data-125179}
my_site <- 125179
```
PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a tributary to Missinka River, 1km upstream of the confluence, on the Chuchinka-Missinka FSR. The road tenure holder is the Ministry of Forests. This crossing is located approximately 660m east of PSCIS crossing 125180 and joins this adjacent stream just before emptying into the Missinka River. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [93I.117](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/parsnip/archive/2022-05-27/FishPassage_093I.116.pdf). This crossing has been remediated, with a bridge installed in the summer of 2022. 

<br>

This site was first assessed by @irvine2020ParsnipRiver in 2019. At that time, there were two culverts side by side. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for follow up due to the 2km of suitable upstream high value habitat, where the presence of bull trout and rainbow trout had been previously confirmed. This watershed was classified as fisheries sensitive under the Forest Practices and Range Act (FRPA) regulations due to downstream bull trout and arctic grayling. As stated in @irvine2022PEAF22F3577DCARestoring, further reasons for restoration at this site include the fact that "the Missinka River watershed is utilized by a possibly genetically distinct, self-sustaining dusk’ihje (Arctic grayling) population with the mainstem of the river providing critical habitat for fry and adult fish." Additionally, regions accessed by the Chuchinka-Missinka FSR provided major harvesting and silviculture obligations. Site plan designs were developed thanks to the ongoing communication and collaboration between SERNBC, Mcleod Lake Indian Band, Sinclair Group, and FLNR.   Photos showing a comparison of the culvert assessment conducted in 2019 versus the completed bridge construction in 2022 are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125179-02).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d02)."))`

In the summer of 2022, a monitoring survey was conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft at crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model

#### Recommendations {-}

Following the remediation of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, it is recommended that future monitoring be conducted at this location. This would help track the stream's morphological changes over time, as well as provide insight into the fish migration patterns in this system. Electrofishing and tagging target species in this stream would aid in gaining a higher understanding into fish movements. Additionally, fishing and monitoring in the adjacent stream (at PSCIS crossing 125180) would also be key in providing a reference site.
